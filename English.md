### Self-intro

Hello interviewer, I sincerely appreciate this valuable interview opportunity provided by **Bosch**. My name is Zehao Zhang, and I am currently a 24th-year master student majoring in software engineering at the School of Software, Nanjing University. I am interested in applying for the position of Middleware Embedded Development. Next, I will briefly introduce myself.

In terms of academic performance, I have achieved excellent grades during my academic career. During my undergraduate studies, I ranked first in my major in the school and passed the CET-6. In terms of awards, I received the National Scholarship in 2019-2020. 

In terms of internships, during the summer holiday, I interned at Vivo Mobile Communications Co., Ltd., holding the position of Storage System Engineer. I was responsible for the development and maintenance of storage modules within the Linux kernel. During my tenure, I primarily resolved issues related to file system storage data inconsistency in practical projects and participated in contributions to the Linux open-source community.

This experience deepened my understanding of kernel fundamentals and enhanced my ability to read large-scale project source code and swiftly locate bugs.

In terms of projects, a significant project experience I had was the design and implementation of a simulated x86 32-bit Linux-like operating system kernel. This project referenced the design of the Linux operating system, developed a kernel prototype, and has currently achieved fundamental kernel functionalities such as hard disk loading, interrupt and exception handling, virtual memory management with multi-level page tables, process scheduling and concurrency, privilege level isolation, and some system calls like sleep, fork, and exec.

In addition, during my undergraduate studies, I served as the class monitor and the president of the School of Computer Association, which also helped me develop my personal organizational coordination and communication skills.

That's my basic information. I hope to communicate and learn with you in this interview. Thank you!

My hometown Nanchang is the capital of Jiangxi Province in southeastern China. It is called “hero city” because **Nanchang Uprising took place in 1927 there.** There are lots of places of interest in Nanchang, including **Teng Wang Pavilion, Bayi Square, Bayi Memorial, Wanshou Palace** and so on. There are many different kinds of famous food in Nanchang, and I think the mixed powder and earthen pot soup are the most delicious. Generally speaking, Nanchang is a great city and welcome to Nanchang.

### 爱好

My hobbies all comes from computer. I love drawing by using computer and making animation. I enjoy the combination of modern technology and art. I have been making animation since primary school. At that time, Adobe Flash is the main software which I used. But now, the software is no longer popular. HTML5 have taken its place for website.



### 社团

I joined the NCU Tea. It is an association for students sharing the programming skills with each other. I learned basic algorithms and data structures in the first year. In my sophomore year, I was responsible for inviting new students and teaching them what I learned in first year.

I think the association brings a good studying atmosphere to the college.



### 优缺点

Yeah. First It is true that it is important for us to know our strengths and weakness. It could help us improve ourself more quickly. 

I think my strength is I am  a optimistic person, that means I can face difficulty and always trying to find out solution. And I have the persistance to concentrate on something for a long time. 

As for weakness,  is that I tend to have a bit too many concerns before taking action, which can lead to missing some opportunities. However, it also means that I tend to consider things more thoroughly. I believe I should be more decisive in my actions.

### 联想

"I know that Lenovo was founded in China and has a global presence as a well-known large-scale company. Its main businesses include manufacturing intelligent devices, selling PCs, and providing cloud services. I chose Lenovo for two reasons: first, C++ development is a suitable job for me, and second, because I have been using Lenovo devices since childhood. My home's desktop computer, my current y9000p laptop, and my monitor are all Lenovo products. For me, I have a certain personal attachment to Lenovo. I also hope to work in Shenzhen because I have elderly relatives living there, and I can take this opportunity to visit them frequently."

困难

I'm sure that the current situation is quite challenging. Over the past two years, the job market hasn't been favorable, and during this period, I have to juggle internship tasks, campus recruitment, and my graduation thesis. I'm dealing with multiple tasks simultaneously, which puts a significant test on my capabilities.
