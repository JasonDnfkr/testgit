### Self-intro

Hello everyone, I'm glad I have the opportunity provided by **MicroStrategy**. My name is Zehao Zhang, and I am currently a master student majoring in software engineering at Nanjing University. I am interested in applying for the position of Backend Software Engineer. Next, I will give a brief introduction about myself.

In my academic performance, I have achieved excellent grades during my academic career. During my undergraduate studies, I ranked first in my major at the school. In terms of awards, I received the National Scholarship in 2020 (two thousand twenty). 

Currently, I have been interned in Huawei Cloud Computing Company from August to now as a backend engineer, participated in the development of online experiment sandbox, implemented some interfaces and business logic.

I interned at vivo Smartphone from May to August, working as a Storage System Engineer. I was responsible for the development and maintenance of storage modules within the Linux kernel. I primarily resolved issues related to file system, and data inconsistency. I also give some contributions to the Linux open-source community.

As for my project experience,  I implemented a thrity-two-bit Linux-like operating system kernel prototype, based on intel x-eighty-six CPU.  I mainly referenced the design of the Linux operating system. It has some fundamental kernel functionalities, such as hard disk loading, interrupt and exception handling, virtual memory management, process scheduling and concurrency, privilege level isolation, and some system calls like sleep, fork, exec and printf.

In addition, during my undergraduate studies, I served as the class monitor and the president of the School of Computer Association. These experiences greatly improved my communication skills and taught me the value of effective teamwork.

That's my basic information. Thank you for considering my application, and I'm excited to learn more during this interview. Thank you.

### 为什么想来XX城市

Shanghai is one of the modest city in China. It impressed me a lot.

My hobbies all comes from computer. I love drawing by using computer and making animation. I enjoy the combination of modern technology and art. I have been making animation since primary school. At that time, Adobe Flash is the main software which I used. But now, the software is no longer popular. HTML5 have taken its place for website.



### 社团

I joined the NCU Tea. It is an association for students sharing the programming skills with each other. I learned basic algorithms and data structures in the first year. In my sophomore year, I was responsible for inviting new students and teaching them what I learned in first year.

I think the association brings a good studying atmosphere to the college.



### 优缺点

Yeah. First It is true that it is important for us to know our strengths and weakness. It could help us improve ourself more quickly. 

I think my strength is I am  a optimistic person, that means I can face difficulty and always trying to find out solution. And I have the persistance to concentrate on something for a long time. 

As for weakness,  is that I tend to have a bit concerns before taking action, which can lead to missing some opportunities. However, it also means that I tend to consider things more thoroughly. I believe I should be more decisive in my actions.

困难

I'm sure that the current situation is quite challenging. Over the past two years, the job market hasn't been favorable, and during this period, I have to juggle internship tasks, campus recruitment, and my graduation thesis. I'm dealing with multiple tasks simultaneously, which puts a significant test on my capabilities.
