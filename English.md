### Self-intro

Hello interviewer, thank you very much for giving me this valuable opportunity to interview with Lenovo. My name is Zhang Zhehao, and I am currently a 24th-year master student majoring in software engineering at the School of Software, Nanjing University. I am interested in applying for the position of backend developer. Next, I will briefly introduce myself.

In terms of academic performance, I have achieved excellent grades during my academic career. During my undergraduate studies, I ranked first in my major in the school and passed the CET-6. In terms of awards, I received the National Scholarship in 2019-2020. 

In terms of projects, I have mainly been involved in two project experiences:

First, I designed and implemented a Linux operating system kernel based on x86-32. This project mainly used C language to implement a prototype of the Linux operating system kernel. Currently, it has implemented basic kernel functions such as hard disk loading, interrupt and exception handling, virtual memory management of multi-level page tables, process scheduling and concurrency, and privilege level isolation, and supports some system calls such as sleep, fork, exec, etc.

Second, I implemented a TCP/IP network protocol stack. This project mainly implemented a simple network protocol stack based on the four-layer network model of TCP/IP, which can parse and send received data packets. Currently, it supports the parsing and sending of ARP, ICMP, UDP, and TCP data packets.

In addition, during my undergraduate studies, I served as the class monitor and the president of the School of Computer Association, which also helped me develop my personal organizational coordination and communication skills.

That's my basic information. I hope to communicate and learn with you in this interview. Thank you!



### 最喜欢的课程

介绍一门专业课/学的最好的课程/最喜欢的课程

My favorite course is Operating Systems, as you can see from my projects, which are related to it. Operating Systems allow me to delve into the underlying knowledge of computers and to study in detail the process of program execution, as well as explore the principles of programming languages and CPUs.



### 家乡

My hometown Nanchang is the capital of Jiangxi Province in southeastern China. It is called “hero city” because **Nanchang Uprising took place in 1927 there.** There are lots of places of interest in Nanchang, including **Teng Wang Pavilion, Bayi Square, Bayi Memorial, Wanshou Palace** and so on. There are many different kinds of famous food in Nanchang, and I think the mixed powder and earthen pot soup are the most delicious. Generally speaking, Nanchang is a great city and welcome to Nanchang. 



### 为什么想来XX城市

I ve heard about xx city. It impressed me a lot. **One of my roommate comes from there and he often invites me to pay a visit to the city.** 

The city is in the south, and I prefer studying and living in the south. 

It is a great choice for me to continue my study life in xx city if it is possible.



### 爱好

My hobbies all comes from computer. I love drawing by using computer and making animation. I enjoy the combination of modern technology and art. I have been making animation since primary school. At that time, Adobe Flash is the main software which I used. But now, the software is no longer popular. HTML5 have taken its place for website.



### 社团

I joined the NCU Tea. It is an association for students sharing the programming skills with each other. I learned basic algorithms and data structures in the first year. In my sophomore year, I was responsible for inviting new students and teaching them what I learned in first year.

I think the association brings a good studying atmosphere to the college.



### 优缺点

Yeah. First It is true that it is important for us to know our strengths and weakness. It could help us improve ourself more quickly. 

I think my strength is I am  a optimistic person, that means I can face difficulty and always trying to find out solution. And I have the persistance to concentrate on something for a long time. 

As for weakness, I think that I am not very confident about talking to the public, I often felt nervous. So I am trying to change this situation. I joined our college association in fresh year and try to make myself more confidence. 



### 南京大学

Nanjing University is a super cool university located in Nanjing, China. It's got a really rich history and culture and is one of China's top universities. They're especially great in fields like math, physics, bio, chem, and also stuff like literature, history, and philosophy. The campus is really nice and has everything you need for studying and living. Definitely check it out if you're looking for a place to study!



### 联想

"I know that Lenovo was founded in China and has a global presence as a well-known large-scale company. Its main businesses include manufacturing intelligent devices, selling PCs, and providing cloud services. I chose Lenovo for two reasons: first, C++ development is a suitable job for me, and second, because I have been using Lenovo devices since childhood. My home's desktop computer, my current y9000p laptop, and my monitor are all Lenovo products. For me, I have a certain personal attachment to Lenovo. I also hope to work in Shenzhen because I have elderly relatives living there, and I can take this opportunity to visit them frequently."



### 规划

First of all, I hope to further my learning and make achievements in my current field. Secondly, I hope to use this internship as an opportunity to become a full-time employee in the company during the autumn recruitment. I will fulfill my responsibilities according to the company's management and arrangement.
